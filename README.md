## Language Dictionaries

All Language Dictionaries were moved from the database to discrete JSON files located at `app/assets/lang-dictionaries/`. Do not use the dictionaries found in the database as they are deprecated/outdated. The files must be manually maintained and kept in sync between all languages.

`legacy/`: Contains the original language dictionaries moved from the database

`other directories/`: Keep new dictionaries contextually separated in directories.

### Endpoint: GET translation/:langCode/:dictionary?

The API's `GET translation/` endpoint was changed to respond these JSON files. It maintains its original signature (retro-compatible) but it adds a new optional `:dictionary` parameter for contextual dictionaries. If no `:dictionary` parameter is passed, it will default to the `legacy` dictionary.
