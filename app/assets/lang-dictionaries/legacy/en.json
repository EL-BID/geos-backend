Sometimes teachers show skill in the personal use of ICT, however, teachers, managers and specialists who provide support for the use of ICT in school may not be aware of their educational potential. Thus, the axis measures the skill of teachers, school managers and support staff. We emphasise the difference between ICT skills and didactic use of ICT skills, which involves knowing when, how and why to use them.",

The 4-dimensional theory is an important conceptual framework to guide the construction of consistent innovation and technology plans. The four dimensions are:",
		"dimensionsDescription2": "The use of technologies in education highlights the insertion of the school in the digital context, requiring actions that leverage this development, such as continued training of educators for the use of electronic devices in teaching practice in a manner that combines theory and practice; the curation of resources that should be used when teaching and learning; the appropriate infrastructure to foster teaching practice and active participation of students; and the strategy to succeed throughout this process. By inserting innovation and technology into educational policies, there are improvements in four main aspects: management, quality, equality and contemporaneity.",
