Sometimes teachers show skill in the personal use of ICT, however, teachers, managers and specialists who provide support for the use of ICT in school may not be aware of their educational potential. Thus, the axis measures the skill of teachers, school managers and support staff. We emphasise the difference between ICT skills and didactic use of ICT skills, which involves knowing when, how and why to use them.",

The 4-dimensional theory is an important conceptual framework to guide the construction of consistent innovation and technology plans. The four dimensions are:",
		"dimensionsDescription2": "The use of technologies in education highlights the insertion of the school in the digital context, requiring actions that leverage this development, such as continued training of educators for the use of electronic devices in teaching practice in a manner that combines theory and practice; the curation of resources that should be used when teaching and learning; the appropriate infrastructure to foster teaching practice and active participation of students; and the strategy to succeed throughout this process. By inserting innovation and technology into educational policies, there are improvements in four main aspects: management, quality, equality and contemporaneity.",
		"dimensionsDescription3": "Policies for the implementation of technologies in education usually establish, as aim or objective for their proposals, the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to improve the quality of education, in addition to addressing matters of infrastructure, manager and teacher skills and the existence of educational support materials.",

However, given the different realities of the two countries, it is convenient to adapt this policy, resulting in a new proposal that considers the structure and functioning of education systems and the relationships between the federal, state and municipal spheres, as well as the context of Brazilian schools.",
		"dimensionsDescription5": "The Four in Balance concept has been used in both the development and the evaluation of educational situations aiming at the effective and efficient use of ICT in education.
